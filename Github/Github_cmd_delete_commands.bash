Certainly! Here is a step-by-step guide with the commands to delete a file from a GitHub repository using the command line:

Clone the repository to your local machine (if not already cloned):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of your repository.

Navigate to the local repository directory:

bash
Copy code
cd repository
Replace repository with the actual name of your local repository folder.

Use the git rm command to remove the file from the repository and the working directory. Replace filename.ext with the actual name of the file you want to delete:

bash
Copy code
git rm filename.ext
Commit the changes to the repository with a meaningful commit message:

sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Delete filename.ext"
Replace Delete filename.ext with a description of the file you are deleting.

Push the changes to GitHub to delete the file:

perl
Copy code
git push origin master
This command pushes the changes to the master branch of your GitHub repository, effectively deleting the file.
